Product Requirements Document (PRD) — DeliaNexus Website
1. Overview

Project Name: DeliaNexus
Industry: Fashion • Digital Media • Health & Wellness
Deployment:

Frontend: HTML + Tailwind (hosted on Hostinger)

Backend: Supabase (database, API, and storage for images)

Goal:
To build a simple yet professional website for DeliaNexus that presents its three divisions — Fashion, Digital, and Health — while enabling an admin to manage content easily through Supabase.

2. Objectives

Provide a unified online presence for DeliaNexus.

Allow non-technical admin updates (adding products/services via Supabase dashboard).

Display products and services attractively to users without requiring logins or sign-ups.

Call directly — open their dialer with the company number.
